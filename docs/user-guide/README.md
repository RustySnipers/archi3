## üöÄ Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Access Archie**: Open your web browser and go to your Archie interface
2. **Initial Configuration**: Complete the setup wizard
3. **Voice Calibration**: Test your microphone and speakers
4. **Connect Services**: Link your smart home devices and services

### Basic Interaction

Archie responds to both voice commands and text input. You can:
- **Speak naturally**: "Archie, turn on the living room lights"
- **Type commands**: Use the text interface for complex requests
- **Upload files**: Share images, documents, or audio files for processing

## üé§ Voice Interaction

### Wake Word

By default, Archie responds to the wake word **"Archie"**. You can change this in settings.

**Examples:**
- "Archie, what's the weather like today?"
- "Archie, set a timer for 10 minutes"
- "Archie, play some relaxing music"

### Voice Commands Structure

**Basic Pattern:**
```
[Wake Word] + [Command] + [Context/Details]
```

**Examples:**
- **Simple**: "Archie, turn on the lights"
- **Specific**: "Archie, turn on the bedroom lights to 50% brightness"
- **Conditional**: "Archie, if it's after sunset, turn on the porch light"

### Natural Language Processing

Archie understands natural speech patterns:

‚úÖ **Works Well:**
- "Archie, I'm heading to bed, can you turn off all the lights?"
- "Archie, it's getting dark, maybe turn on some lights?"
- "Archie, the living room is too cold, increase the temperature"

‚ùå **Less Effective:**
- Very long, complex sentences
- Multiple unrelated commands in one sentence
- Unclear pronouns ("turn that off")
